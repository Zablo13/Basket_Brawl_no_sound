🏀 Basket Brawl

A fast-paced 2D basketball battle game made with Godot Engine. I often played games like Brawlhalla, Rocket League or Rayman's Kung Foot with friends. I had an idea for a multiplayer game which plays like a brawler, but uses baskets instead of goals which can only be defended with good timing against enemy attacks.
This is my very first self-developed game project, the artwork was drawn in Aseprite.

✨ Features

🎮 Local Multiplayer: Play 1v1 or 2v2 with friends.

🏀 Arcade-style Gameplay: Quick, fun, chaotic basketball battles.

⚡ Competitive Moves: Slam dunks, trickshots, parries, and more.

🎨 Custom Assets: My very first self-developed game project.



🚀 How to Play

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Zablo13/Basket_Brawl_no_sound.git
cd BasketBrawl


Open the project in Godot Engine (v4.x recommended).

Press ▶ Run to start the game.

Pick your mode (1v1 or 2v2) and brawl!
